# Fake-News-Detector
Fake news on different platforms is spreading widely and is a matter of serious concern, as it causes social wars. This project aims to detect false information and real news using logistic regression algorithms and natural language processing techniques, implement the model using Python.

STEP 1: Imported the dataset from Kaggle dataset, modified the dataset and saved in Excel.csv format.
STEP 2: Used Jupyter Notebook for executing python coding and removed all unwanted data from dataset.
STEP 3: Then dataset is separated into training dataset and testing dataset.
STEP 4: Visualization are made in Streamlit Python Framework for better understanding of dataset.
STEP 5: Finding accuracy using Logistic Regression
